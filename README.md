## Description
HarmonyIQA introduces a **benchmark dataset** and a **model** for Image Harmonization Quality Assessment. It provides:
- A large-scale dataset with images harmonized using multiple state-of-the-art harmonization algorithms.
- Subjective human ratings assessing image harmonization quality.
- A learning-based evaluation model aligned with human perception.

## Dataset
The HarmonyIQA dataset consists of:
- **1,350 harmonized images** generated by **9 different Image Harmonization Algorithms (IHAs)**.
- **Human opinion scores (MOSs)** collected through subjective experiments.
- Comprehensive **benchmarking results** on image harmonization quality assessment models.

## Model
The **HarmonyIQA Model** is trained to predict the perceptual quality of harmonized images, leveraging human ratings and deep learning techniques.
